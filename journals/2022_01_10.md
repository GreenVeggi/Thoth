- social-ecological urbanism
	- ontology (worldview, starting point)
		- a view of the city as a living [[system]]
	- mission is to integrate sociotechnical systems with ecosystems
		- sociotechnical --> biosociotechnical
	- from urban dependence on local hinterlands and direct feedbacks
		- to global dependence and obscure indirect feedbacks
	- urbanism - studies how urban form interacts with experience and [[behaviour]]
		- urban form sees space as technology interacting with social processes (sociotechnical systems)
		- the compact city model (15 minute city)
			- walkable, humancentred, energy effective
				- problem: lack of green space recreation
		- urban nature requires more space, but support wellbeing
		- [[ecosystem services]] - human benefits from services
		- urban form and connection to nature - daily experiences matter
		- erosion (extinction) of nature experience - daily experiences and increased screen time
			- 12% of English kids did not visit a nature environment during a twelve month period Sogae et al 2012
		- social-ecological urbanism
			- methods to observe and analyse experiences in cities
				- PPGIS
				- smarthphone app
				- clicker devide
				- BIG data methods on the rise
					- BIG project
						- better life quality with Integrative GIS (GÃ¤vle)
					- making space for resilient wellbeing (PhD Karl Samuelsson)
						- topdiversity
						- distribution of destinations
						- network configuration
						- natural landscape
			- resilience of functions generated by biosiociotechnical systems
				- resilience
					- absorb crises, renew, and continue to develop
					- resilience theory (Holling 1973)
						- resilience theory aims to understand nonlinear dynamics..
						- adaptive cycle
							- ecological resilience (adaptive renewal cycle)
							- slow changing variables for reorganisation
					- redundancy
						- coral sea
							- abundance and redundancy of species of grazers (strong resilience)
							- erosion due to over-fishing (low diversity)
							- disturbance (weak resilience)
