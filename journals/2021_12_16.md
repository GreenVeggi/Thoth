- [[resilience]]: In its original everyday meaning, the term 'resilience' derives from the Latin verb "resilire" ("to jump back"), referring to "the ability to recover quickly from difficulties" (Oxford dictionaries)
	- Measuring resilience
	- Differences between [[sustainability]] and [[resilience]]:
		- sustainability
			- mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions
			- formal institutions (legally binding [[system]] of rules, laws)
			- quantitatively oriented towards measurable goals ("targets")
		- resilience
			- defensive strategy
			- adaptive approach to solving problems whose consequences are not always known in advance ("wicked problems")
			- [[adaptation]] to the consequences of increased greenhouse gases
			- informal [[institutions]] ([[norms]], locally adapted rules)
			- qualitatively oriented towards more pragmatic goals ("good enough")
- [[resilience thinking]]: "_Resilience thinking is a way of looking at the world. It is about seeing systems, linkages, thresholds, and cycles and things that are important to us and the things that drive them. It is about embracing change, as opposed to striving for constancy._"

- Short historic overview of resilience discourse.
	- In the 1940s and 1950s, the concept of psychology arose in connection with the negative effects of adverse life events such as exclusion, poverty and traumatic stressors on vulnerable individuals and groups - especially children (Glantz & Johnson, 1996).
	- The technical/physical interpretation of resilience became clear in the 1960s and 1970s, where resilience was defined as "the material's ability to absorb energy when it deforms elastically and then regains energy" (Callister & Rethwisch, 2012). Thus, a property of the system to return to the original state.
	- In ecology, in the 1970s, resilience was defined as "the ability of ecosystems to absorb natural disturbances (fires, storms, floods, insect infestations, etc.)" (Holling, 1973).
	- The concept of social–ecological resilience emerged in the late 1990s (Berkes & Folke, 1998), reflecting a new paradigm meant to overcome the separation of social from natural sciences and to
	  create a new intellectual basis for responding to the ‘environmental’ challenges of the modern world (Berkes & Folke, 1998).

	- Conventional resource management has come under criticism for being equilibrium-based and for having an underlying assumption of stability.
- Adaptive resource management
	- Holling, C. S., & Meffe, G. K. (1996). Command and Control and the Pathology of Natural Resource Management. Conservation Biology, 10(2), 328–337. #hollingCommandControlPathology1996
	- Adaptive management identifies uncertainties, and then establishes methodologies to test hypotheses concerning those uncertainties. It uses management as a tool not only to change the system, but as a tool to learn about the system (Resilience Alliance).
	- This approach is very different from conventional resource management with its focus on maximum sustainable yields and quota management with little feedbacks to ecosystem dynamics (Holling & Meffe 1996).
	- Adaptive management as rediscovery of traditional systems of knowledge and management.
		- Adaptive management is an integrated method for resource and ecosystem management. It is adaptive because it acknowledges that environmental conditions will always change, requiring societies to respond by adjusting and evolving. Adaptive management, like some traditional knowledge systems, emphasises processes and assumes that nature cannot be controlled and yields cannot be predicted.
		- Uncertainty and unpredictability are characteristics of all ecosystems, including managed ones. In both cases, social learning appears to be the way in which societies respond to uncertainty. Often this involves learning not at the level of the individual but social learning at the level of society or [[institutions]].
