- institutions and property rights
	- [[institutions]] - rules and norms of society and their enforcement characteristics
	- regulatory structures for use and management of natural systems
		- formal
			- legal rules
			- written down
			- enforced by third-party authorities
			- costly to enforce
			- political rules, economic rules, contracts, laws, constitutions
		- informal
			- [[norms]] and conventions
			- unwritten codes for human conduct
			- enforced by social pressure/self-enforced
			- less costly to enforce
			- dress codes, family rules, taboos, rituals
	- property rights regimes
		- private property
		- state property
		- common property
		- open access
	- Property rights regimes are necessary but not
	  sufficient conditions for resource sustainability!
	  They help avoiding the [[tragedy of the 
	  commons]] that results from an inadequate specification of property rights to environmental services.
