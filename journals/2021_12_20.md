- institutions and property rights
	- [[institutions]] - rules and norms of society and their enforcement characteristics
	- regulatory structures for use and management of natural systems
		- formal
			- legal rules
			- written down
			- enforced by third-party authorities
			- costly to enforce
			- political rules, economic rules, contracts, laws, constitutions
		- informal
			- [[norms]] and conventions
			- unwritten codes for human conduct
			- enforced by social pressure/self-enforced
			- less costly to enforce
			- dress codes, family rules, taboos, rituals
	- property rights regimes
		- private property
		- state property
		- common property
		- open access
	- Property rights regimes are necessary but not
	  sufficient conditions for resource sustainability!
	  They help avoiding the [[tragedy of the 
	  commons]] that results from an inadequate specification of property rights to environmental services.

		- Tragedy of the commons
			- Picture a pasture open to all... the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd... the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a [[system]] that compels him to increase his herd without limit-in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom of the commons brings ruin to all (Hardin 1968).
			- Elinor Ostrom showed that Hardin’s example of a commons is in fact an open access system – a system without norms and rules.
		- Three general principles of property rights.

- social taboos in traditional resource management
- urban green commons
