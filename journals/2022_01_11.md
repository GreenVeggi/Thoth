- urban design - structures and shapes urban processes by way of urban form
	- social
	- economic
	- ecological
	- technological
- built form/urban form - the difference between symbolic and functional form
	- interesting dialectics
	- the importance of the relation between the parts rather than the parts in themselves
	- how we describe the world determines what we know about the world
		- language descriptions
		- geometric descriptions
			- cities as areas
			- cities as networks
				- network analysis - the seven bridges of Königsberg
				- space syntax and three nine-room buildings
		- mathematical descriptions
- space syntax - the concept of affordance
	- the theory of affordances (Gibson, 1979) - "affordances is what emerges in the meeting between properties of the physical environment and human abilities"
	- slightlines in affordance theory (Gibson 1979)
	- axial map in space syntax theory (Hillier and Hanson 1984)
	- network of axial lines
		- axial lines as nodes and links
	- measuring distance as centrality, mean distance from one point to all other points
		- measure distance in space, time, costs ...
			- measurement in space
				- distance
				- topological
				- angular distance
- relation between urban form and urban life - large empirical invesitgation
	- observations through scanning of anonymised WIFi signals from mobile phoens
	- ..
- spatial morphology -
