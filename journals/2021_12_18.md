						- affordable
						- reliable
						- low to no CO2-emissions
						- safe for humans and the environment (green energy)
						- reasonable trade-offs (land use change, for example)
							- grow food, solar parks - what happens on the land?
							- context-dependent
						- energy independence (geopolitical)
				- wind, solar, hydro, and tidal power, geothermal energy, ambient heat captured by heat pumps
				- proposed EU policy: nuclear as a green energy source
				- [[green resources]] - resources which do not harm the environment
					- often determined via [[life cycle analysis]]

		- non-renewable are rocks, minerals
