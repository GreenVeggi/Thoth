- Humans and our societies depend on the work of nature. [[ecosystem services]] - many and varied benefits that humans freely gain from the natural environment and from properly-functioning ecosystems; linking the work of nature to human wellbeing

	- ten key messages
	- social ecological urbanism (SEU) - [[institutions]] and [[urban form]] as tools for governing urban processes
	- integrating ecosystems into urban planning and design
	- promoting food security by integrating ecological information into urban planning
	- urban ES - promoting urban green related human health benefits
		- growing body of literature shows that more greenness close to where people live and better accessibility to green areas is useful for improving human health
	- urban areas and public health
		- cities are generally associated with lower levels of physical activity, which increases risks for a wide range of diseases such as those of cardiovascular origin and other non-communicable diseases.
		- while representing the most densely populated areas on the planet, cities also experience an increasing trend of mental illness, particularly linked to social isolation
		- health gap
			- health challenges tend to manifest themselves differently among different socioeconomic groups in society
			- groups with higher socioeconomic status tend to be correlated with better health than groups with lower socioeconomic status
			- health benefits provided by urban green areas have been shown to have proportionally larger positive effects from lower socioeconomic groups, which are generally considered at higher risk of poverty-related stress and associated health issues
	- identifying areas of opportunity
		- locations where increasing accessibility to urban green areas will contribute the most to closing the health gap
