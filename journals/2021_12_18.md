- [[natural resources]] - resources that exist without any actions of humans, _e.g._ sun, forest, minerals, animals, plants, air, oil, water, soil
	- we can choose to use them when you want.
	- renewable _versus_ non-renewable natural resources
		- renewable resources are solar energy, wind, trees, cows, water
			- renewable energy sources
				- does renewable equal sustainable?
					- related, but not equal
					- sustainable energy use ([[social-ecological systems]])
						- affordable
						- reliable
						- low to no CO2-emissions
						- safe for humans and the environment (green energy)
						- reasonable trade-offs (land use change, for example)
							- grow food, solar parks - what happens on the land?
							- context-dependent
						- energy independence (geopolitical)
				- wind, solar, hydro, and tidal power, geothermal energy, ambient heat captured by heat pumps
				- proposed EU policy: nuclear as a green energy source
				- [[green resources]] - resources which do not harm the environment
					- often determined via [[life cycle analysis]]

		- non-renewable are rocks, minerals
		- renewable resources won't run out within a human life
			- top soil - takes about 500 years to renew, renewable?
- [[ecosystem]] - consists of all the organisms (biotic) and the physical environment (abiotic) with which they interact
	- rainforest, savanna, coral reef, pond, desert, marine, lake
	- [[systems thinking]]
	- [[biome]] - looking at global ecosystems; large collection of flora and fauna occupying a major habitat
		- taiga, desert, steppe
	- biotic and abiotic components, comprising an ecosystem, are linked together through [[nutrient cycles]] and energy flows. Some nutrient cycles are special
		- Nitrogen cycle. All plants need nitrogen. N has gaseous phase, so circulation is pretty fast (as opposed to phosphorus cycle). Today effort goes into planting species that can sequester N into ground.

		- Water cycle. Solid, liquid phase, and gaseous. Interseting about hydrologic cycle is the trees (important for keeping cool), who help with evapotranspiration.
		- Phospherus cycle. No gaseous phase. When P drains out into lakes, you have to manually get it out. Nature did it in the ice age by moving around rocks. Key nutrient for plant.
		- Carbon cycle. Crucial.
			- photosynthesis : 6 CO2 + 6 H2O -(light)--> C6H12O6 + 6 O2
			- energy enters the systems through photosynthesis and is incoporated into plant tissue
			- when Earth was very young, vulcanos did this ...
			- the evolution of vascular plants (408 - 360 mill years ago)
				- the Devonian vascular plant "explosion", plants could grow high (more up than moss)
				- as plants covered the land, photosynthesis increased worldwide, started a decrease in CO2 levels by fixing carbon into both soil and sediments
			- Carboniferous period, 360 - 300 million years ago
				- The growth of these forests remove huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, from 4000 ppm  to 400 ppm ((closer to what it is today)), leading to an oxygen surplus (35%).
				- Size reached by insects and similar creatures is thought to
