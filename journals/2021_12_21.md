- Ecosystem Services (ES) - humans and our societies depend on the work of nature
- today ES are the limiting factor - need for a modified worldview, reconnecting with nature
	- traditional worldview
		- early economic theory didn't have nature as the limiting factor, it was more something to conquer
	- social-ecological systems worldview
- economic values and valuation
	- focus is on anthropocentric valuation and valuation methods
	- ecosystem services link is crucial when striving for sustainable management of complex social-ecological systems (folke et al 2011)
	- valuation in this context can provide powerful information for better understanding trade-offs and for evaluating alternative management strategies
	- economic values are context-dependent, _i.e._ they are relative values; if context changes, value changes
	- values can be measured in a variety of units, depending on the context and goal of the valuation exercise (_e.g_. dollars, tons per hectare, measure of noise produced per unit area)
	- catch the intensity in human preferences through change in quality and quantity of a specific asset (such as biodiversity)
- non-economic values (anthropocentric focus)
	- cultural values, _e.g._ "sense of place", religious values, beauty, social [[cohesion]], _et cetera_
	- manifests through social [[norms]] and practices
	- economic valuation can in these contexts be inadequate, or even misguiding
- coordinated efforts to address economic valuation
	- social-ecological systems worldview
	- natural capital project
		- Nat Cap and the InVEST model recognises the need of the scientific community to deliver knowledge and tools to quantify and forecast the return on investments in nature by developing tools for quantifying the values of natural capital
		- biophysical models are the basis for everything
		- iterative process with stakeholders
	- ipbes - science and policy for people and nature
		- Intergovernmental Panel of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is a conceptual framework that encompasses both intrinsic values and anthropocentric values and valuation methods, which are applicable to ecosystem services
			- instrumental and intrinsic values are the distinction between what is a means to an end and what is an end in itself
			- things are deemed to have instrumental value if they help one achieve a particular end; intrinsic values, by contrast, are understood to be desirable in and of themselves (no-no for economic valuation)
	- TEEB
		- The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity draws attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity and highlights the growing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation
		- ambition is to act as a catalyst to help accelerate the development of a new economy that fully reflects the values of natural capital and ecosystem services which this capital supplies
- Different value domains
	- biophysical measures and indicators
		- quantifying ecosystem service performance involves the sue of biophysical measures and indicators
		- difficulty of measuring ecosystem services in biophysical terms increases as the focus shifts from provisioning, to regulating to habitat, to cultural services
		- biophysical measures of ecosystem services are a prerequisite for sound monetary valuations and often provide powerful information in their own right
	- monetary values
		- often used when a common denominator is needed in a policy context to help describe a trade-off
		- method used to assign a monetary value often has to do with the ease by which a given good or service can be described and how easy it is to survey a particular human population's assessment of that value
		- when a population cannot be directly surveyed (due to cost or access limitations), data to estimate those values can be used - but this is subject to many constraints
	- cultural ecosystem services and social and cultural values
		- MA (2005) describes cultural services as indlucding:
			- cultural diversity
			- spiritual and religious values
			- knowledge systems (traditional and formal)
			- educational values
			- inspiration
			- sense of place
			- cultural heritage values
			- recreation and ecotourism
		- social and cultural values often necessitate the use of more holistic approaches and methods that may include qualitative measures, constructed scales, and narration
	- health values
		- parameters such as nature experiences, local identity and natural heritage fit well within the cultural service classification, but they are potentially also tightly linked to human health values
	- insurance values
		- contribution of ecological infrastructure and ecosystem services to increased resilience and reduced vulnerability of societies to shocks has been referred to as a form of insurance value
			- Engström, Gren, Li, Krishnamurthy 2020. Valuing biodiversity and resilience: and application to pollinator diversity in the Stockholm region. Spatial Economic Analysis. Provides an example of how ecological and economic information need to be merged, that this is doable, but also challenging. Also, the issue of economically valuing resilience is addressed.
- Monetary valuation methods
	- hedonic pricing (RP)
		- impact of environmental quality attributes on prices is distinguished from other factors that affect prices
		- for example, a natural scenic view or proximity to a nature reserve might raise the price of a house; this methods looks at revealed preferences
		- RP - revealed preferences - preferences shown through people's choices
		- SP - stated preferences
		- although our results suggest that urban parks indeed have a positive effect on property value and that this effect tends to increase with reduced distance to tthe parks, the hedonic pricing information is not enough to make well-advised decisions in a sustainable planning context (engström, gren  Capturing Values 2017); we thus suggest
			- including and quantifying additional health benefit dimensions
			- replacing straight-line measures with an axial line step distance measure, to better capture accessibility
			- applying an ecosystem service lens to better capture the range of benefits
			- taking the surrounding land use configuration into account for optimising the different values of urban parks
	- travel cost (RP)
		- infers value people assign to visiting a nature area or engaging in a recreational activity such as fishing
		- can be estimated based on the related costs people will pay for the experience (another revealed preferences method)
		- RP - revealed preferences - preferences show through people's choices
		- SP - stated preferences
	- choice experiemtns
		- 'stated preference' method
		- involve analysing values on which people make decisions
	- contingent valuation (SP)
		- based on surveys that ask how much respondents would be willing to pay for specific benefits
	- production function/damage cost and replacement cost method
		- used to estimate how much an ecosystem service (especially regulatory services like flood protection and pollination) contributes to another service or commodity that has market value
			- example: gren and polasky 2010 Quantifying Biodiversity for Building Resilience for Food Security in Urban Areas: Getting Down to Business. Ecology and Society 15(3):20.
			- They propose an approach for measuring the change in [[flow]] and [[resilience]] of a regulating ecosystem service on a landscape scale over time when the landscape is exposed to both land use change due to urban expansion and change in a large-scale economic driver (global drop prices).
			- Results quantitatively show that there can be a substantial decrease in resilience, due to negative effects on response diversity, without detecting any major decrease in ecosystem service generation over time, thus generating a sense of false security and sustainability.
			- This paper illustrates the importance of addressing multiple drivers of change simultaneously within a sustainability resilience context.

- Insights
	- Fundamental ecological knowledge is needed to do constructive valuation!
	- "The economic invisibility of nature is the main reason for losing it!" (TEEB, Pavan Suchdev)
	- Be aware of the limitations of valuation, such as the problem of marginal change approaches and tipping points (TEEB).
	- Valuation could be a complement to other information when forming guidelines for sustainable ecosystem management!
	- Science/policy interface is crucial (IPBES).
- Dealing with multiple services and value dimensions
	- multi-criteria analysis (MCA)
		- ranking of preferences that serve as a basis for taking decisions among different alternatives, but without the need to convert all values to a single unit
		- therefore, it is a tool that accounts for complexity in decision-making processes
		- weakness in this method is that the weighing of values can be easily biased by power asymmetries among stakeholders and between stakeholders and scientists
	- structured decision making (SDM)
		- approach to identify and evaluate options and making choices in complex decision situations and is particularly useful for decisions involving the integration of technical analysis with value-based deliberations
		- designed to deliver insight to decision makers about how well their objectives may be satisfied by potential alternative courses of action
		- loops through phases:
			- clarify the decision context
			- define objectives and measures
			- develop alternatives
			- estimate consequences
			- evaluate trade-offs and select
			- implement, monitor, and review
			- clarify the decision context
- Considerations for design of economic valuation studies
	- valuation should always be policy focused, avoiding doing valuation for the sake of valuation
	- scenario planning is a useful tool to generate policy relevance
	- assessments focus on marginal changes in ecosystem services between different scenarios (as opposed to attempting to estimate total service provisioning for each ecosystem service)
	- usually, one scenario will be the 'business as usual' or 'do nothing' which extrapolates the _status quo_ into the future
