- Ecosystem Services (ES) - humans and our societies depend on the work of nature
- today ES are the limiting factor - need for a modified worldview, reconnecting with nature
	- traditional worldview
		- early economic theory didn't have nature as the limiting factor, it was more something to conquer
	- social-ecological systems worldview
- economic values and valuation
	- focus is on anthropocentric valuation and valuation methods
	- ecosystem services link is crucial when striving for sustainable management of complex social-ecological systems (folke et al 2011)
	- valuation in this context can provide powerful information for better understanding trade-offs and for evaluating alternative management strategies
	- economic values are context-dependent, _i.e._ they are relative values; if context changes, value changes
	- values can be measured in a variety of units, depending on the context and goal of the valuation exercise (_e.g_. dollars, tons per hectare, measure of noise produced per unit area)
	- catch the intensity in human preferences through change in quality and quantity of a specific asset (such as biodiversity)
- non-economic values (anthropocentric focus)
	- cultural values, _e.g._ "sense of place", religious values, beauty, social [[cohesion]], _et cetera_
	- manifests through social [[norms]] and practices
	- economic valuation can in these contexts be inadequate, or even misguiding
- coordinated efforts to address economic valuation
	- social-ecological systems worldview
	- natural capital project
		- Nat Cap and the InVEST model recognises the need of the scientific community to deliver knowledge and tools to quantify and forecast the return on investments in nature by developing tools for quantifying the values of natural capital
		- biophysical models are the basis for everything
		- iterative process with stakeholders
	- ipbes - science and policy for people and nature
		- Intergovernmental Panel of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is a conceptual framework that encompasses both intrinsic values and anthropocentric values and valuation methods, which are applicable to ecosystem services
			- instrumental and intrinsic values are the distinction between what is a means to an end and what is an end in itself
			- things are deemed to have instrumental value if they help one achieve a particular end; intrinsic values, by contrast, are understood to be desirable in and of themselves (no-no for economic valuation)
	- TEEB
		- The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity draws attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity and highlights the growing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation
		- ambition is to act as a catalyst to help accelerate the development of a new economy that fully reflects the values of natural capital and ecosystem services which this capital supplies
