- [[social-ecological systems]] - SES concept was first coined in an interdisciplinary research project at the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics in 1998, referred to as "the [[linking-project]]" (Dynamics of Ecosystem-Institution Linkages for Building Resilience).
	- The purpose of the linking-project is to analyse critical linkages in social-ecological systems, and to generate insights on how to interpret, respond to, and manage feedbacks from complex adaptive systems (_e.g_. ecosystems).
		- The long-term objective was to improve resource management.
