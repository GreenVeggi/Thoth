- [[institutions]] - rules and norms of society and their enforcement characteristics, institutions determine when, where, how, and how much resources can be taken
- Traditional natural resource management.
	- Focus of the [[linking-project]] was to study small-scale societies that have survived over long time periods through resource management that builds resilience in interlinked social-ecological systems.
		- Objective
			- insights on design principles for sustainable resource management.
		- frame of analysis

		- basic findings from the [[linking-project]] #berkesRediscoveryTraditionalEcological2000
			- management practices that build resilience
			  in social-ecological systems
				- practices also found in conventional resource management:
					- monitoring resource abundance and ecosystem change
					- total protection of certain species
					- protection of specific habitats
					- temporal restrictions of harvest
				- practices largely abandoned in conventional resource management:
					- multiple species management
						- [[polyculture]] - cultivation of multiple species of crops on the same piece of land
							- ![image.png](../assets/image_1639726610100_0.png)
							- no use of fertilisers, pesticides, and field machinery
							- reduces the risk of total crop failure
							- promotes water conservation in the soil
							- reduces soil erosion and insect pests
					- resource rotation
						- ![image.png](../assets/image_1639726747551_0.png)
					- succession management
						- shifting cultivation/swidden cultivation
							- ![image.png](../assets/image_1639726854768_0.png)
							- common in all tropical regions
							- covers 30% of the world's exploitable soils
							- promotes biodiversity when long fallow periods are observed
					- practices related to management of ecosystem resilience, seldom found in conventional resource management
						- watershed-based management
						- responding to and managing disturbance and surprises
						- nurturing sources for ecosystem renewal

	- [[traditional ecological knowledge]]
		- knowledge is often handed down through generations by oral, cultural transmission
		- high reliance on qualitative rather than quantitative information
		- knowledge is based on long-term experience with the ecosystem
		- knowledge has a strong belief component
- social functions
	- to differentiate between profane and sacred entities
	- psychological reasons
	- mark group-adherence
	- classification function
	- Resource and habitat taboos
		- temporal taboos
		- method taboos
		- life-history taboos
		- segment taboos
		- specific species taboos
		- habitat taboos
			- ecological functions
				- protect ecosystem/habitats
				- maintain ecosystem services
				- protect threatened species
	- TEK benefits
		- TEK offers new biological knowledge and ecological insights to researchers
		- Fine-tuned to local ecological dynamics
		- Some TEK systems provide models for sustainable resource management
