- Key terms in the thinking of Germany’s Wuppertal Institute and the US Rocky Mountain Institute. To be sustainable during a period when human populations will likely double and average living standards increase significantly, industry needs to increase its resource conversion efficiency by a minimum Factor 4 (_i.e_. 75% reductions in resource consumption for any unit of production).
