- Proposed by Professor Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek of Germany’s Wuppertal Institute, the MIPS approach focuses on the “material intensity per unit service.” The approach aims to measure the “total material and energy throughput in mass units (like kilograms or tonnes) per unit good or per mass unit of good, from cradle to grave.” As the units of service clock up for a product like a car, so the MIPS “invested” in each unit of service supplied fall. The greater the durability of the product, within limits, the fewer the MIPS needed per unit of service. #definition
