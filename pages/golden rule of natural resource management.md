- Natural resource management should strive to retain critical types and ranges of natural variation in ecosystems. That is, management should facilitate existing processes and variabilities rather than changing or controlling them. By so doing, [[ecosystem resilience]] and the organising processes and structures of [[ecosystem]]s will be maintained, thus better serving not only the natural functions and species diversity of those systems but also the long-term (although not necessarily short-term) interests of humanity.
