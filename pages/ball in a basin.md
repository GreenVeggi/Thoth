- Metaphor explaining how resilient [[system]]s work. If the ball is pushed a little bit, it will return to the bottom of the basin, _i.e._ to its initial state. If the ball is pushed hard enough, it will leave the basin and eventually settle somewhere else, _i.e_. in an additional state. The height of the basin thus corresponds with [[resilience]] capacity: the higher the basin, the harder of a push the ball can withstand and still return to its initial stage.
