- In [[space syntax]] theory, co-presence [[group]] of people who may not know each other, or even acknowledge each other, who appear in spaces that they share and use. Co-present people are not a community, but they are said to be the raw material for the creation of a community, which may in due course become activated, and can be activated if it becomes necessary.
