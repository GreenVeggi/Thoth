	- What divides multidisciplinarity from interdisciplinarity and [[transdisciplinarity]] is the lack of iterative research, a failure to cross disciplinary boundaries, the lack of integration in the research process, and a failure to engage non-academic [[stakeholder]]s as participants in the research.
	- In addition, multidisciplinarity may sometimes focus on the theme under investigation—rather than being problem oriented, and may or may not involve a coordinated programme of research.
