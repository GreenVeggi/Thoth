- Set of procedures for studying the relational structure of [[group]]s and networks mathematically and graphically. Using information about the relationships (ties, edges) linking members (nodes, vertexes), the method yields member-level indexes (_e.g_. centrality and betweenness), group-level indexes (_e.g_. density and cohesiveness), and a graphic representation of the unit. #definition
