- Takes a [[system]]s approach to describe and evaluate the impacts of various human activities on the environment. A [[system]]s appraoch is essential for this as it enables consideration of the complex interrelationships among different elements of the system, recognising that the behaviour of the whole system is quite different from its individual elements when considered in isolation from each other.
