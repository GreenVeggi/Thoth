- Causal mechanism by which variations in mutual focus of attention and rhythmic entrainment transmute shared mood into collective effervescence; and result in feelings of solidarity and respect for group symbols. Successful IRs generate emotional energy (EE)â€”high levels of confidence, enthusiasm, and initiative; failed IRs reduce EE. Individuals are motivated to repeat interactions that result in high EE, and to avoid those that lower EE. The IR mechanism explains differences in personality, as well as behavior in political and social movements.
