- [[system]] consisting of two interacting [[subsystem]]s: the biological (epidemiological [[ecosystem]]) and the social (social and economic conditions of life of the society) subsystems where the biological [[subsystem]] plays the [[role]] of the governed object and the social acts as the internal regulator of these interactions.

- [[complex adaptive system]]s with key characteristics such as:
	- integrated biogeophysical and socio-cultural processes,
	- self-organisation,
	- nonlinear and unpredictable dynamics,
	- feedback between social and ecological processes,
	- changing behaviour in space (spatial thresholds) and time (time thresholds),
	- legacy behavioural effects with outcomes at very different time scales,
	- emergent properties, and
	- the impossibility to extrapolate the information from one SES to another.

- An ecological system intricately linked with and affected by one or more social systems. An ecological system can loosely be defined as an interdependent system of organisms or biological units. "Social" simply means "tending to form cooperative and interdependent relationships with others of one’s kinds". Broadly speaking, social systems can be thought of as interdependent systems of organisms. Thus, both social and ecological systems contain units that interact interdependently and each may contain interactive subsystems as well.
