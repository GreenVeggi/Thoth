- Organism which lives in more stable environments. They have favourable living environmental conditions. Hence, their survival is much more ensured. These organisms have protection since the environmental changes are predictable. Therefore, these organisms are ready for the living conditions. Moreover, K strategists are high in population and therefore, do not have the urge to reproduce rapidly. Thus, they do not show an exponential growth rate. K strategists are larger in size and have longer lifespans. They have a low mortality rate, and the rate of being harmed is reduced. #definition
