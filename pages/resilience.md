- Ability of an [[ecosystem]] to absorb disturbances, renew itself and continue within a specific state. His research made it clear that it is the resilience of the system that decides the durability of [[variable]]s and relations within the [[system]], and thus its aptitude for renewal and endurance when under stress. #definition

- Measure of the perturbation that can be absorbed before an ecosystem is shifted into another state. In this definition, systems are complex and self-organizing, permeated by uncertainties and discontinuities, and have several possible equilibrial states.
