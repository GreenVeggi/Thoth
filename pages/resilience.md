- Ability of an [[ecosystem]] to absorb disturbances, renew itself and continue within a specific state. His research made it clear that it is the resilience of the system that decides the durability of [[variable]]s and relations within the [[system]], and thus its aptitude for renewal and endurance when under stress. #definition

- Measure of the perturbation that can be absorbed before an [[ecosystem]] is shifted into another state. In this definition, [[system]]s are complex and self-organising, permeated by uncertainties and discontinuities, and have several possible equilibrial states.

- Capacity of a [[system]] to absorb stress, to continue to develop, and to change without a loss of essential structure, function, identity, and feedback.
